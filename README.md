Percy's Audio Code

Alrighty mates, here lies the code files for:

1. Custom Low Pass Filter
2. Audio Manager
3. Commentary System

For the Audio Manager, all that is needed to create a stationary sound is:

AudioManager.createAudioObject (AudioClip audioClip, float audioVolume, string audioName, bool isLooping)
overloads exist for just the audio clip as well as volume.

Commentary Logic is still in progress at time of waiting.
